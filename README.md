# Data-Visualization-of-Olympic-Data-Using-Tableau
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p> In this project, I used Tableau to visualize the data describing the Air Polution in different countries all around the world. The dataset that is used was downloaded from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibalmuzdadid/global-air-pollution-dataset'> here</a>. This dataset contains information about the concentration of different pollutant species within the air (e.g., carbon monoxide and ozone). </p><br>
<h2>NO2 AQI</h2>
<p> In the following figure the countries whose AQI is greater than 5 is shown:<br>

As can be seen South Korea, USA, China, Algeria, South Africa and Chile have hire NO2 AQI compared to the rest of the world. </p>
